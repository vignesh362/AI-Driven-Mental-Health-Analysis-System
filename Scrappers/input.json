I didn\u2019t recognize myself anymore.  I feel like they lost their mom mentally and physically for a year. Today was the first day of Kinder for my youngest, and now that both our kids are in elementary school I am just having a hard time. It\u2019s hard to put into words but all those feelings of shame, and guilt for missing so much came rushing back. I felt just so sad, and like life was out of my control. Like they grew up more and continued on in life when I was sick. I missed out. I want to be happy for the milestones and the growing up but man I am just having a hard time. \n\nNow that I am so much better mentally, sometimes I get these feelings of extreme overwhelm, like life is out of control and just happening to me. I shame and guilt myself with how bad things got mentally. And I just feel so sad, when i wish i could just feel happy for them . \n\nThanks for listening to this.",
